## Introduction and background
Natural science collections are a primary resource for mapping out the world’s biodiversity through the long-term preservation of collected specimens (Buschbom et al. 2022). 


## Development of the Latimer Core standard

## Implementation in DiSSCo Flanders
The DiSSCo Flanders project aims at obtaining high-level information on the Natural Science Collections held in the collection-holding institutions in Flanders that participate in the DiSSCo-Flanders project. This information consists of quantitative data on the overall size of the collections, as well as size by taxonomic groups, preservation types, stratigraphic age, geographic region, and level of digitization (Van Baelen et al. 2022). Based on previous work done in the SYNTHESYS+ project (Smith et al. 2019), a survey was designed to retrieve relevant information on the collections.  
Although the design of the survey was loosely based on the developments happening at the TDWG Collections Descriptions Interest Group, the survey remained static over time while the development of the Latimer Core standard was going through major changes. In order to ensure the interoperability of the collected data a mapping exercise was performed of the data with the current terms and concepts of the standard.
